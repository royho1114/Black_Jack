This Black Jack calculator is expected to  include two (or three) parts:
The first part is to calculate a winning rate using c++.
The second part is to build a UI using swift on iOS.
There probably will be a third part: to build a simulaion game to test the calculator.

This is work is out of my interest in probability calculation and app design.
Also, since I am not very experienced in version control using Git and GitHub, this is also a good chance to gain some experience!
